> Starter kit for a project using Gulp workflow.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

## Getting Started
* './js/main.js' is your main JavaScript file
* Add all third-party script files into './js/lib/' and you can specify if you would want to bundle them with your 'main.js' file by modifying `jslib_files` in './gulpfile.js'
* './scss/main.scss' is your main SCSS file
* You may import all your secondary SCSS files into 'main.scss' with `@import` statements or if you would like Gulp to process all your SCSS files to CSS files, set `paths.styles.main` in './gulpfile.js' to an empty string.
